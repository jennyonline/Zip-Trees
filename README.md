# Zip-Trees
Implementations of Zip-Trees and related data structures done by me as part of my bachelor thesis at Freie Universität Berlin.

The implementations are based on the following (pseudo)codes:

**Zip-Trees:** <br/>
Robert E Tarjan, Caleb C Levy, and Stephen Timmel. Zip trees. 
   In Workshop on Algorithms and Data Structures, pages 566–577. Springer, 2019
      
**Treaps:**  <br/>
Raimund Seidel and Cecilia R Aragon. Randomized search trees. Algorithmica, 16(4-5):464–497, 1996

**Skip-Lists:**  <br/>
William Pugh. Skip lists: a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees. 
   Communications of the ACM, 33(6), 1990
      
**AVL-Trees:**  <br/>
Niklaus Wirth. Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs. Prentice-Hall, 1976

**Red-Black-Trees:**  <br/>
Java TreeMap class

There is an iterative, a recursive as well as an optimized version of Zip-Trees. The iterative and recursive ones are based on the referenced paper, the optimized version is a faster version introduced by us. <br/>
There is also a class determined to counting the low ancestors within a Zip-Tree.
